/* Notes:
1. The messages are classified by which module's .c file prints them out.
You must follow this classification to be sure your modules behave like ours.
Note that p1_main does all printing except for data about individual Persons, 
Meetings, or Rooms, which is output by their print_ function.

2. Where two percent signs appear in a row ('%%'), change it to the appropriate 
printf formatting item. 

3. If there is no actual constant text involved in an output statement, it
is not shown here. For example, the printf for printing a Person's data just
outputs the data with one space between each item. This format is not shown here.

4. Note how the command error messages listed below are output by p1_main; thus, 
functions in other modules must return an error condition to p1_main, 
which then prints the appropriate message from this list.
