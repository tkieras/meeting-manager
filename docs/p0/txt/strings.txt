/* Notes:
1. Two or more strings on the same line would be part of the same
line of output, with some variable value output between them.

2. If there is no actual constant non-whitespace text involved in an output statement, it
is not shown here. For example, the output statement for printing a Person's data just
outputs the data with one space between each item.
